/* MacTCP ABI conformance: sizes and byte offsets of the parameter
 * blocks an application shares with the .IPP driver.
 *
 * This file is deliberately dual-mode, and the two modes answer two
 * *different* questions:
 *
 *   Native (-DEXECUTOR), against multiversal's generated MacTCP.h:
 *       does the header the generator produced actually lay out the
 *       way defs/MacTCP.yaml says it does?  The `size:` assertions in
 *       the YAML only pin total sizes, so a mac68k alignment mistake
 *       in the middle of a struct that happens to preserve the total
 *       can slip through.  These per-field offsets catch that.
 *
 *   Retro68, against Apple's Universal Interfaces MacTCP.h:
 *       are those numbers actually correct?  This is the ground truth.
 *
 * The expected values below have been confirmed field by field against
 * Universal Interfaces 3.4.2, by compiling Apple's MacTCP.h for a
 * 4-byte-pointer target with 2-byte packing (which is what mac68k
 * alignment amounts to for these types) and reading back the offsets
 * the compiler computed.  Two blocks did *not* match the MacTCP
 * Programmer's Guide, and both are called out where they appear below:
 * TCPReceivePB's field order, and TCPStatusPB's connStatPtr, whose
 * omission also made TCPiopb 98 bytes instead of 102.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the Retro68 half only means something when it compiles
 * against *Apple's* headers.  Retro68 generates its CIncludes from the
 * same multiversal YAML that Executor uses, so if MacTCP.yaml is ever
 * added to Retro68's multiversal too, building this against those
 * generated CIncludes would compare our definitions to themselves and
 * prove nothing.  Genuine Universal Interfaces must come first on the
 * include path.
 *
 * Today that happens by default: Retro68's multiversal has no MacTCP
 * definitions at all, so <MacTCP.h> there can only be Apple's, which
 * arrives via Retro68's interfaces-and-libraries.sh from a copy of
 * Apple's Universal Interfaces you supply yourself.  Retro68's own
 * LaunchAPPL/Server/MacTCPStream.cc is a working MacTCP client built
 * that way, and every parameter block field it touches agrees with the
 * names used here.
 *
 * To re-confirm after a change:
 *
 *     ./tests --gtest_filter=MacTCPABI.DumpLayout   # native, ours
 *     ... same test built as the Retro68 application, run under
 *     Basilisk II or on real hardware via LaunchAPPL ...
 *     diff ours.txt apples.txt
 *
 * A compile failure on the Retro68 side is itself a result: it means a
 * field name in defs/MacTCP.yaml does not match Apple's.
 *
 * The expected values are written out here rather than derived from
 * the YAML, so that a transcription error in the YAML shows up as a
 * failure instead of being quietly mirrored.
